# F1-EngineAudio-Simulator
Developed the first comprehensive audio dataset featuring high-quality onboard audio for the entire 2024 Formula 1 season. With 20+ tracks, it includes lap-wise audio for all 20 drivers across all 10 teams, totaling ~400GB. This dataset, complete with metadata, serves as a valuable resource for Audio Information Retrieval research in F1 engine analysis.

Stage-I
Developed an algorithm capable of analyzing F1 engine audio inputs (.wav files) to predict the driver, classify the team / engine and identify the track from where the input audio has been taken â€” all based solely on the audio snippet!!
Here is a demo of the prediction: <YT unlisted vid link>
