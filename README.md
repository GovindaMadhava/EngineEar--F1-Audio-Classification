# Formula1-EngineAudio-Simulator
Developed the first comprehensive audio dataset featuring high-quality onboard audio for the entire 2024 Formula 1 season.
Dataset Stats:
25 Tracks | 20 Drivers | 10 Teams | ~25,000 Laps | ~500 GBs of high quality wav data
Link to Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindamadhava/formula1-f1-pure-engine-audio-dataset-2012-2024 

Stage-I:
Developed an algorithm capable of analyzing Formula 1 engine audio inputs (.wav files) to predict the driver, classify the team / engine and identify the track from where the input audio has been taken â€” all based solely on the audio snippet!!

Here is a demo of the prediction: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiK7pWxcARgYFQ7vz39x6qGJntNXrZyN7


Stage-II: Neural-Network based Real-time Formula 1 Engine Simulator (in progress)

Generative Audio based Real-time Simulator for each of the 10 Formula 1 2024 Engines.
This would be the most detailed Audio Simulator that enables users experience the adrenaline of F1 engines through haptic feedback along with real-time generative Neural-networks audio, for an immerive experience. 

-Engine Ignition ON | Engine IDLE | Engine Burnout and Warm-Up | Launch control | Up-shift and Down-shift along with throttle input | PIT Limiter | Engine OFF
